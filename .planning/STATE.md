# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-12)

**Core value:** The realtime lane battle is the heart of the game; every meta-system (accounts, economy, progression, matchmaking) exists to make that loop matter over time.
**Current focus:** Phase 09 — backend-foundations-integrity

## Current Position

Phase: 09 (backend-foundations-integrity) — EXECUTING
Plan: 6 of 6
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-06-12

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Context

### Decisions

- v2.0 is a foundational slice: accounts, economy, progression, matchmaking, server-auth — not the whole game.
- Authority model = Option A (Supabase-only result validation). Dedicated Colyseus game-server is out of scope (documented upgrade path only).
- Phases ordered by dependency + risk: backend integrity → services/sim refactor → accounts+economy → progression → matchmaking+ranking → battle authority (highest risk, last).
- The four competitive "should-have" systems (hidden MMR, per-unit/tower upgrades, visible rank, match history) pulled into scope.
- UI/UX and characters owned by user in Claude designs; GSD milestone integrates them, does not design them.
- [Phase ?]: 09-01: Explicit vitest imports (no globals) to keep prod tsc scope clean; separate tsconfig.test.json for test type-checking; hand-built ROWS×COLS grids for deterministic pathfinder tests
- [Phase ?]: Typed src/lib/api/ seam (account/rooms/wallet) wraps all scene table calls; wallet writes route exclusively through credit_wallet RPC
- [Phase ?]: Added scene-entry guard + per-handler guards in LobbyScene; 'guest' identity literal removed phase-wide; role union preserved (FND-02, D-04/D-05/D-06)

### Blockers

- None.

### Todos

- None yet.

### Research flags (at plan time)

- Phase 14 (Battle Authority / determinism pass) — highest-risk; run research-phase flag.
- Phase 13 (Matchmaking) — focused pass on atomic MMR pairing under load + lifecycle/timeout design.

## Milestone History

- v1.0 Prototype — realtime 1v1 lane-battle prototype (phases 0–8): scaffold, art pipeline, auth, lobby, placement, core battle, units/towers, maps/pathfinding, polish. Shipped as the foundation for v2.0.

## Session Continuity

Resume file: None

✓ Resolved 2026-06-12: Reworded REQUIREMENTS.md (FND-02) + ROADMAP.md (Phase 9 Goal/SC#2)
to the email-only identity criterion (D-04, no anonymous auth) before planning Phase 9, so
the verifier checks against the email-only criterion.
