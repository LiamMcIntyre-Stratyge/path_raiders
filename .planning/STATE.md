# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-12)

**Core value:** The realtime lane battle is the heart of the game; every meta-system (accounts, economy, progression, matchmaking) exists to make that loop matter over time.
**Current focus:** Phase 09 — backend-foundations-integrity

## Current Position

Phase: 09 (backend-foundations-integrity) — COMPLETE ✓ (verified PASS)
Plan: 6 of 6 executed
Status: Phase 9 done. Next: Phase 10 (`/gsd:discuss-phase 10` or `/gsd:plan-phase 10`)
Last activity: 2026-06-12

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 17% (1/6 v2.0 phases)

Open follow-ups (non-blocking, by design):
- RLS integration test (test/rls/wallet-rls.test.ts) live-runs in CI on first push (no local Docker in dev).
- Live prod deploy confirmed via user "pushed" sign-off; optional final Dashboard audit for auditability.

## Context

### Decisions

- v2.0 is a foundational slice: accounts, economy, progression, matchmaking, server-auth — not the whole game.
- Authority model = Option A (Supabase-only result validation). Dedicated Colyseus game-server is out of scope (documented upgrade path only).
- Phases ordered by dependency + risk: backend integrity → services/sim refactor → accounts+economy → progression → matchmaking+ranking → battle authority (highest risk, last).
- The four competitive "should-have" systems (hidden MMR, per-unit/tower upgrades, visible rank, match history) pulled into scope.
- UI/UX and characters owned by user in Claude designs; GSD milestone integrates them, does not design them.
- [Phase ?]: 09-01: Explicit vitest imports (no globals) to keep prod tsc scope clean; separate tsconfig.test.json for test type-checking; hand-built ROWS×COLS grids for deterministic pathfinder tests
- [Phase ?]: Typed src/lib/api/ seam (account/rooms/wallet) wraps all scene table calls; wallet writes route exclusively through credit_wallet RPC
- [Phase ?]: Added scene-entry guard + per-handler guards in LobbyScene; 'guest' identity literal removed phase-wide; role union preserved (FND-02, D-04/D-05/D-06)

### Blockers

- None.

### Todos

- None yet.

### Research flags (at plan time)

- Phase 14 (Battle Authority / determinism pass) — highest-risk; run research-phase flag.
- Phase 13 (Matchmaking) — focused pass on atomic MMR pairing under load + lifecycle/timeout design.

## Milestone History

- v1.0 Prototype — realtime 1v1 lane-battle prototype (phases 0–8): scaffold, art pipeline, auth, lobby, placement, core battle, units/towers, maps/pathfinding, polish. Shipped as the foundation for v2.0.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-06-12
Stopped at: Phase 10 context gathered — 10-CONTEXT.md written (5 areas: sim purity, determinism seams, towers, gameState reduction, verification). Phase 09 complete (all 6 plans executed + verified PASS; backend boundary live, Vitest+CI, api seam, email-only identity). Next: `/gsd:plan-phase 10`.
Resume file: .planning/phases/10-services-simulation-refactor/10-CONTEXT.md

✓ Resolved 2026-06-12: Reworded REQUIREMENTS.md (FND-02) + ROADMAP.md (Phase 9 Goal/SC#2)
to the email-only identity criterion (D-04, no anonymous auth) before planning Phase 9, so
the verifier checks against the email-only criterion.
